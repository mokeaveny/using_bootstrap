Created the first main section of the newsweek article which can be seen at the url https://www.newsweek.com/

Objective of the repository was to learn the basics of the CSS bootstrap framework. I have created a considerable
amount of the website using bootstrap and will complete the entire article at a further data once I have completed
the course and learnt some more Javascript.
